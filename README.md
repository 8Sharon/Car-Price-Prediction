# car price prediction

# Introduction
This project aims to predict the prices of cars based on various features such as selling price, model, year, mileage, and more. By leveraging machine learning models, we can provide accurate price predictions to assist buyers and sellers in making informed decisions.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes various features relevant to car pricing:

selling price

Model

Year

Mileage

Engine Size

Fuel Type

Transmission

... and more.
# Model Training
The primary machine learning model used in this project is the Random Forest Regressor. The data preprocessing step involves using the Robust Scaler to handle outliers effectively.

# Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated using the following metrics:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Measures the average magnitude of errors in a set of predictions, without considering their direction.

Mean Squared Error (MSE): Measures the average of the squares of the errors—that is, the average squared difference between the estimated values and the actual value.

R-squared (R²): Indicates how well the independent variables explain the variability of the dependent variable.
